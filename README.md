# Password-generator
Just a simple password generator that allows you to choose from letters, uppercase and symbols and also allows you to copy the password.

It's a small project that I may use/need every so often that helped me practice HTML, CSS and js. 
It allows you to choose a length of the password between 1 character and 50 whilst also using a toast message when a user copies the password 
to let them know that the password has been copied. This message will pop up if the user uses the "copy password" button however the user 
will get an alert if they use CTRL + C to copy it.
